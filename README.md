## Challenge 1 - Reverse Array
The main goal of this first challenge is to get practice with whiteboarding and thinking through issues.
### Challenge
Given an input array, build a function to return the array with all elements in reverse order.  No built-in language methods may be used.

## Challenge 2


## Challenge 3 - Array Binary Search
We are building a binary search function to better understand how binary searches are performed to find values quickly in an array of any length.
### Challenge
Make a function that takes in a sorted array and a value.  Perform a binary search to find the value in the array and return the index position.  Return -1 if the value is not in the array.  No pre-built methods may be used.
